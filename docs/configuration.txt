Sophie Configurations
=====================

Single vs Multiple Blogs
------------------------

By default, each Sophie instance runs only one blog, which uses whatever root
url Sophie is plugged into. That is, assuming the url for Sophie is routed as::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # ...
        (r'^root/to/blog/', include('sophie.urls'),
        # ...
    )

the url for the blog's front page would be `root/to/blog/`, for the first page
of the entry list would be `root/to/blog/entries/1/`, etc.

However, Sophie does support running multiple blogs with a single instance
under the same root url. In this case, each blog will have an identifier, or
rather, an "slug". With the same setup as above, for blogs with slug "blog1"
and "blog2", their front pages' url would become `root/to/blog/blog1/` and 
`root/to/blog/blog2`, and the first pages of entry list would be
`root/to/blog/blog1/entries/1/` and `root/to/blog/blog2/entries/1/`.

The multi-blog feature is disabled by default. To enable it set
`SOPHIE_MULTIPLE_BLOG` to `True` in project's `settings.py` file.
