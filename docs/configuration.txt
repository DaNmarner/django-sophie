Sophie Configurations
=====================

Single vs Multiple Blog Mode
----------------------------

By default, each Sophie instance runs only one blog, which uses whatever root
url Sophie is plugged into. That is, assuming the url for Sophie is routed as::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # ...
        (r'^root/to/blog/', include('sophie.urls'),
        # ...
    )

the url for the blog's front page would be `root/to/blog/`, for the first page
of the entry list would be `root/to/blog/entries/1/`, etc.

However, Sophie does support running multiple blogs with a single instance
under the same root url. In this case, each blog will have an identifier, or
rather, an "slug". With the same setup as above, for blogs with slug "blog1"
and "blog2", their front pages' url would become `root/to/blog/blog1/` and 
`root/to/blog/blog2`, and the first pages of entry list would be
`root/to/blog/blog1/entries/1/` and `root/to/blog/blog2/entries/1/`.

The multi-blog feature is disabled by default. To enable it set
`SOPHIE_ENABLES_MULTIBLOG` to `True` in project's `settings.py` file.

Although the blog slug is hardly used in single blog mode, your blog still 
has a slug, which is `default`. Feel free to change it to anything you want.
But keep in mind that in Multiple blog mode, the slugs aren't optional anymore.
And more importantly, as explained above, they become part of the url. So make
sure they are carefully picked and make the most sense. Of course they can be
modified in the admin backends.
